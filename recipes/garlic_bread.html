        <h1>Easy Garlic Bread</h1>

        <h2>Simple Bites</h2>
        <p>Garlic bread makes every meal better, especially if it’s this buttery, crispy, extra garlicky homemade garlic bread. I’ve been obsessed with this garlic bread for years now and probably make it more often than I should. Why? Because it really couldn’t be easier to make, it’s SO good, and it’s very freezer-friendly so you can keep some on hand for whenever that garlic bread craving hits. …Which for me is pretty much every night. </p>
        <p>Homemade garlic bread with real butter and fresh garlic is incredibly simple to make and so much better than what you’ll find in the freezer aisle at the grocery store. Here’s what you’ll need to make my absolute favorite garlic bread:</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
        <ul>
            <li>1 loaf French or Italian bread (approx. 24" long)</li>
            <li>6 Tbsp butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp olive oil </li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley </li>
            <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
         </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400ºF. In a bowl, stir together the room-temperature butter, olive oil, minced garlic, garlic powder, chopped parsley, and salt until relatively smooth (a few small lumps of butter are okay).</li>
            <li>Cut the loaf in half, into two 12" long pieces, then cut each piece open lengthwise. Lay the bread on a baking sheet cut sides facing up. Spread the garlic butter mixture evenly over the open surfaces of the bread.*</li>
            <li>Bake the bread for 10-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and crispy. Bake for less time if you prefer a softer garlic bread, and more time if you prefer a crispier garlic bread. Cut the bread into 2-inch sections and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Notes</h5>
        <p>*Once the garlic butter is spread over the surface of the bread it can be frozen in gallon-sized freezer bags and baked at a later date. The bread can be baked straight from the freezer, although it may take a minute or two longer to brown.</p>
